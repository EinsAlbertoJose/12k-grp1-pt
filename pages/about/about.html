  <h2> How The Application Was Made </h2>

  <p> The application was created through an Ionic Typescript with the use of if else statements to determine gender and weight when under 5 feet in terms of height; the latter condition tested if the heigh, once converted to inches, was less than or equal to 60 as a foot is 12 inches and anything below that should have a fixed value as stated in the paper. Operations were conducted under the else statements of each gender to determine which values should be multiplied and added. Finally, a claus was added to prevent the app from functioning if there is an insufficient amount of data.</p>
  <br/>

  <h2> How To Use The Application </h2>
  
  <p> You must select the calculator tab then select if you are male or female then proceed to fill out all the data as not doing so would not allow the app from proceeding. After this, press the compute button and you should get the 4 Weights which are considered Ideal according to the calculations set by their respective experts.</p>
